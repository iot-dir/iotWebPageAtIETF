TITLE
The Internet of Things at the IETF

INTRODUCTION
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity to enable objects to exchange data with the manufacturer, operator and/or other connected devices.

BODY
The Internet of Things refers to a system with devices that are often constrained in communication and computation capabilities, now becoming more commonly connected to the Internet (or at least to an IP network), and to various services that are built on top of the capabilities these devices jointly provide. It is expected that this development will usher in more machine-to-machine communication using the Internet with no human user actively involved.

IoT is a very rapidly growing area of technology and connects with a number of other emerging technologies. Several IETF working groups, spanning multiple areas are developing protocols and best common practices that are directly relevant to the IoT on the communication and security aspects. These protocols are used by a variety of companies, as well as other IoT standards development organizations (SDOs) and alliances, to build and specify interoperable systems. Due to the distributed nature of IoT protocol development and use, there is often a need for coordination across different groups working on IoT. 

The IETF IoT Directorate is an advisory group of experts selected by the IETF Internet area directors and the IoT Directorate Chairs. The main purpose of the IoT Directorate is coordination within IETF on IoT-related work and increasing the visibility and communication  between IETF IoT activities and other standards development organizations, industry alliances, and other organizations. A post from the IETF Blog provides an overview of IoT-related work underway within the IETF.

IETF Working Groups (WG) working on IoT-related topics i involve different areas as shown below:

Application Area:

CBOR: Concise Binary Object Representation Maintenance and Extensions:
Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) extends the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON, RFC 8259) data interchange format to include binary data and an extensibility model, using a binary representation format that is easy to parse correctly.

ASDF: A Semantic Definition Format for Data and Interactions of Things
The objective of the ASDF working group is to develop the Semantic Definition Format into a standards-track specification for thing interaction and data modelling. In the process of developing this specification, further functional requirements that emerge in the usage of SDF for model harmonization will be addressed

LWIG: Light-Weight Implementation Guidance
The purpose of the LWIG working group is to collect experiences from implementors of IP stacks in constrained devices
https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/lwig/about/
Ipwave: IP Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments
The Ipwave working group works on Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) use-cases where IP is well-suited as a networking  technology and will develop an IPv6 based solution to establish direct and secure connectivity between a vehicle and other vehicles or stationary system

Security Area
COSE: CBOR Object Signing and Encryption
CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE, RFC 8152) describes how to create and process signatures, message authentication codes, and encryption using Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) for serialization. COSE additionally describes a representation for cryptographic keys.
https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cose/about/

RATS: Remote ATtestation Procedures
Remote attestation procedures (RATS) enable relying parties to establish a level of confidence in the trustworthiness of remote system components through the creation of attestation evidence by remote system components and a processing chain towards the relying party.
https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rats/about/
ACE: Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments
The ACE working group aims to produce a standardized solution for authentication and authorization to enable authorized access to resources identified by a URI and hosted on a resource server in constrained environments
https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/ace/about/
SUIT: Software Updates for Internet of Things
The SUIT working group focuses on defining a firmware update solution (taking into account past learnings from RFC 4108 and other firmware update solutions) that will be usable on Class 1 (as defined in RFC 7228) devices, i.e., devices with ~10 KiB RAM and ~100 KiB flash. The solution may apply to more capable devices as well
